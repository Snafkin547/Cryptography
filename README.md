Welcome to the "Cryptography" repository!üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br> 
This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing various cryptographic algorithms and techniques. 

<b>DES Module</b>

The Data Encryption Standard (DES), a prominent symmetric-key algorithm for electronic data encryption developed in the 1970s, was once a benchmark in digital security but has seen a decline due to newer cryptographic methods. In response to its vulnerabilities, notably its short key length, an enhanced version called Triple DES (3DES) was introduced, utilizing multiple DES keys in sequence to significantly bolster security. This advanced version has gained approval from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and is incorporated in numerous cryptographic standards, maintaining its relevance as a secure option for protecting sensitive data, particularly in legacy systems.

This module is an implementation of the DES (Data encryption standard) encryption and decryption processes.

## Code Formatting Standards
My project uses Black, a Python code formatter, to ensure uniform formatting across our codebase. 
Contributors are required to format their code using black . in the root directory before pushing to the repository. 

Additionally, we employ a GitHub Action that automatically checks for compliance with Black's formatting standards on each pull request. 
This check can prevent merging if the code does not meet the required standards. 
It's crucial to remember to run Black before pushing changes, as this not only keeps the code clean and readable but also facilitates the review and merging process by adhering to our automated checks.
